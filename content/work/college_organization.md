I feel like I used organization in the vaguest way possible, but essentially what I mean is systematically keeping track of your schedule, assignments, and files to keep your workflow as streamlined as possible.

## Keeping track of time

If you're an involved student, keeping track of your student life while also managing your extracurriculars and personal life is no simple task. I've found that meticulously organizing an agenda to handle my day-to-day schedule, and curating a through to-do list helps me efficiently plan how I'm going to use my time throughout the week.

I use Google Calendar to keep track of my classes, meetings, and both my personal office hours as well as the office hours for the classes I'm currently taking. I also insert blocks of time that account for any work related to school, my study breaks, and even time to go to the gym. Here is a screenshot of what a typical week looks like for me.

The important thing to note is that even though it appears that I have the majority of each day taken up by something, is that this isn't a strict, immutable plan. In fact, I hardly follow this exact plan most weeks. The important thing to me, is that for one, I know when all of my classes and meetings are, and two, I just lay out a rough idea for how I divide my time between school and studying. To me, this is more realistic, because life happens and your plans can often change abruptly. Rolling with the punches and maintaining a flexible schedule is crucial for me to succeed academically and avoiding burnout.

Complimentary to my agenda is my to-do list. I follow a simple [kanban system](https://www.digite.com/kanban/what-is-kanban/). This splits my to-do items into three categories: to-do, doing, and done.  Keeping track of all of my actionable items means that I never miss deadlines. As soon as I have a task assigned to me, I immediately add it to my "to-do" section. It's fairly simple but has been highly effective for me to manage my schoolwork, TA responsibilities, as well as personal items. For larger projects, I'll typically create subtasks for that project instead of just one to-do item. I use an app called Notion (which I plan on writing an entire blog post about) to host my to-do database, but you can easily do this with good ole-fashioned pen and paper. I prefer a Notion database because I can filter to-dos by my classes, by date, and by urgency. For example, if I filter for a view of the next month of my linear modeling class, where I can see all of my deadlines.

## File management

The last part of this post I want to talk about is the organization of personal computer files. One of my TA responsibilities is to help students learn how to use R and Excel, which means I interface quite often with their computers to help them with whatever they're learning. When I direct them to open some excel or R file, I frequently see that they have all of their files either in their desktop or their downloads folder. And I literally mean all of their files. This makes searching for files much more difficult, and I've had a handful of students have to start their work over because they can't find their files.



 Another common thing I see is that students will have files that are named something like "finaldoc.docx", "finaldocv2.docx", "actuallyfinaldoc.docx" and "TURNTHISINfinal_doc.docx".
