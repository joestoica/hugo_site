Organizing your college life can be incredibly daunting. When I began as a freshman I can distinctly remember being overwhelmed by the sheer amount of new information being thrown at me daily. I now finally feel like I have a few methods for staying on top of my game and keeping my stress levels lower. So let's explore how systematically keeping track of your schedule, emails, and files can keep your workflow as streamlined and efficient.

## Keeping track of time

If you're an involved student, keeping track of your student life while also managing your extracurriculars and personal life is no simple task. I've found that meticulously organizing an agenda to handle my day-to-day schedule, and curating a through to-do list helps me efficiently plan how I'm going to use my time throughout the week.

I use Google Calendar to keep track of my classes, meetings, and both my personal office hours as well as the office hours for the classes I'm currently taking. I also insert blocks of time that account for any work related to school, my study breaks, and even time to go to the gym. Here is a screenshot of what a typical week looks like for me.

The important thing to note is that even though it appears that I have the majority of each day taken up by something, is that this isn't a strict, immutable plan. In fact, I hardly follow this exact plan most weeks. The important thing to me, is that for one, I know when all of my classes and meetings are, and two, I just lay out a rough idea for how I divide my time between school and studying. To me, this is more realistic, because life happens and your plans can often change abruptly. Rolling with the punches and maintaining a flexible schedule is crucial for me to succeed academically and avoiding burnout.

Complimentary to my agenda is my to-do list. I use an app called Notion (which I plan on writing an entire blog post about) to host my to-do database, but you can easily do this with good ole-fashioned pen and paper. I prefer a Notion database because I can filter to-dos by my classes, by date, and by urgency. For example, I can easily filter for a view of the next month of my linear modeling class, where I can see all of my deadlines and what I have left to do. Keeping track of all of my actionable items means that I never miss deadlines. As soon as I have a task assigned to me, I immediately add it to my "to-do" section. It's fairly simple but has been highly effective for me to manage my schoolwork, TA responsibilities, as well as personal items. For larger projects, I'll typically create subtasks instead of just one large to-do item.

Here's what my current to-do list looks like. It's a little empty since I'm coming off a two-week spring break and COVID-19 is turning the entire world upside-down. High-level tasks are things that require multiple steps and typically have deadlines out in the future, and low-level tasks are something that I'll typically get done quickly in the next day or so.

## Email

I'm obsessed with my inbox to an almost unhealthy degree. Coming into college though, the only email address I had was from my AOL instant messaging days, and my inbox consisted only of Club Penguin membership notifications. A few years ago, I stumbled on the philosophy of [inbox zero](https://www.fastcompany.com/40507663/the-7-step-guide-to-achieving-inbox-zero-and-staying-there-in-2018), which I loosely follow but have changed to better fit my needs. Here is my workflow for a new email:

1. Trash it if it's trash.
2. If you need to reply and can do it quickly, do it. Otherwise come back to it later.
3. When the email is complete, archive it in a labeled folder. Don't just leave it in your inbox. At the end of every day, your inbox should contain no emails.

The search functionality is a nice feature to use to find emails, but I think quickly compartmentalizing an email further aids future retrieval if necessary. I use the Mac OS email client on my computer and the Gmail app on my phone and have the folders linked with both.

## File management

The last part of this post I want to talk about is the organization of personal computer files. One of my TA responsibilities is to help students learn how to use R and Excel, which means I interface quite often with their computers to help them with whatever they're learning. When I direct them to open some excel or R file, I frequently see that they have all of their files either in their desktop or their downloads folder. And I literally mean all of their files. This makes searching for files much more difficult, and I've had a handful of students have to start their work over because they can't find their files. Here's an example of the general file structure I use for classes:

{{< figure src="/images/tree.jpg" >}}

I create a folder for homework, notes, and exams for all of the classes I take (classes I TA for typically have different stuff to keep track of). Additional folders are used for things like projects or readings. The more specific your folders are, the easier it will be to navigate and find things, especially if you need to return that folder again to reference something in a few years. Don't be afraid to have a deeply nested folder structure either. If you need 20 subdirectories, then do it!

Another common thing I see is that students will have files that are named something like "finaldoc.docx", "finaldocv2.docx", "actuallyfinaldoc.docx" and "TURNTHISINfinal_doc.docx". This is an easy way to get easily confused and accidentally turn in the wrong assignment. Be deliberate with naming conventions. If you have old versions but want to keep them, move them to a new folder specifically for holding old files. Rename them to keep them separate from your working final document. I recommend to keep the name of your current working document as simple as possible to differentiate it from old versions. This way you'll never confuse yourself with the correct final version. If you're the kind of person to have multiple files open at once, create a naming convention for your assignments and notes to separate them. For my homework, my convention is "class#\_hw#" (so 632_hw7 for example). Similarly, I take all of my notes digitally on my iPad. My naming convention for notes is "class#\_date\_topic" (632_3312020_linear_mixed_models). This is especially handy when I'm looking for something specific and don't remember the date it fell on.

## Wrapping up

Hopefully this post makes you think about the systems you currently employ in your everyday life. If you think some of these ideas can help you out, I encourage you to give them a try! However, you know yourself best and know what will work for you. If a strict inbox structure isn't a priority for you, then there's no reason to set it all up. I would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions about how you stay organized, so fel free to email me at [contactjoestoica@gmail.com](mailto::contactjoestoica@gmail.com). Next week's post is the final part of this series, where we'll talk about productivity. Hope to see you there!
