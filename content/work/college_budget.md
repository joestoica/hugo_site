I've been toying with the idea of writing a post like this for a few months now. There are endless blogs and vlogs offering tips and tricks to students on how to successfully navigate the minefield of being an independent college student for their first time. However, I feel like sharing the various technology and productivity strategies that have added structure to many aspects of my life, which in turn has allowed me to stress less about life and put more focus on being an organized and motivated student. Here are some things that I plan on writing about and release over the next couple of weeks:

- Personal Budget
- Staying Organized
- Being Productive     

## Managing your budget

Personally, nothing stresses me out more than finances. Everyone knows that attending college is not cheap, and it's easy to get overwhelmed with trying to keep track of living expenses, payments for school, and money for your own personal use. There are plenty of students I know who live paycheck to paycheck, and they have rough ideas in their head of what they can spend before their accounts are completely drained (I'm absolutely guilty of this, because I spent the majority of my undergrad mentally calculating if I could afford one more Chipotle burrito bowl).

One day I realized that being blissfully ignorant of the contents of my checking account is most likely not the smartest approach, and I became even more aware of this after applying for my first credit card (which if you don't already have one, you should look into getting one!). This then forced me into the habit of checking my financial apps more frequently since I was deathly afraid of not being able to afford my credit card payments and take on even more debt. Because of my education and familiarity with data software, I was led down a personal finance rabbit hole looking for some way to accurately manage my spending habits and gain potential insights on where I could be making improvements, and this is when I discovered YNAB. YNAB (or You Need A Budget) is a personal budgeting platform that allows you to take better control of the contents of your wallet.

YNAB is built upon [four rules](https://www.youneedabudget.com/the-four-rules/). Here's a quick summary:

1. *Give every dollar a job* - Budget every dollar you currently have by assigning it to a spending category. Don't make projections on what your next paycheck will let you buy.
2. *Embrace your true expenses* - Set aside money for things that you spend money on frequently, such as rent, groceries, or gas, as well as prepare for long-term purchases that you'll have to make. For example, if you set aside money monthly for your textbooks, it will feel like less of a shock to your bank account when you actually have to buy them next semester since you have that money already assigned to that task.
3. *Roll with the punches* - Be flexible with your budget because sometimes life just happens. You might accidentally overspend your budget because you needed more groceries than usual, but YNAB allows you to easily pull some extra cash from any other categories.
4. *Age your money* - This idea is centered around spending last month's earnings on this month's expenses. The older your money, the more you'll stop living paycheck to paycheck.

Not only is budgeting useful, but YNAB helped me figure out where my money was actually going on a monthly basis, because sometimes you don't really realize how much you spend on Chipotle. YNAB allows you to connect your financial accounts directly into the app, however I elected to manually enter all of my purchases myself. This way, I'm extremely aware of how I'm spending my money. Budgeting has illuminated some of my personal spending habits. YNAB has helped me with reprioritizing for all of the essential costs first, and then seeing how much I can actually spend, guilt free.

There is somewhat of a learning curve for using the YNAB software and adopting these philosophies to your spending habits. There are plenty of resources available online, but once you get over the initial hump the payoff is immense. I can honestly say that YNAB has changed my life significantly. I worry much less about my money and where it will go each month, and in turn this allows me to stress about other things, like the exam I have next Thursday (and am currently writing this post instead of studying for). YNAB offers the first year free to students, but then turns to a yearly subscription. But if you budget for it over the year, you won't even worry about it :)
